It would be neat to know if the the canal bridges are up or down when driving to Niagara on the Lake for example.  That information is posted on the web: http://greatlakes-seaway.com/R2/jsp/R2.jsp?language=E&loc=NiaBrdgStatus.jsp  But it would be great if there was another way to access it that make more sense, ie with a phone or by twitter?
